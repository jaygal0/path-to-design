        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Our website uses Plausible Analytics to help us understand visitor
          trends and the effectiveness of our marketing outreach. We chose
          Plausible Analytics because it is a privacy-focused company and
          platform that eschews personally identifiable information in favor of
          anonymous aggregate data. See the Plausible Analytics Data Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from
          unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of
          transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely
          secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>
          Our website may contain links to other websites. We are not
