        <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>
          My name is Joshua Galinato, and I&apos;m a designer too. You can view

          </a>{" "}
          if you&apos;re interested in my journey to becoming a designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a designer, I wanted to further my skills by learning to not only
          design websites but also build them from scratch. I realised this
          personal project could help me expand my network of designers, assist
          aspiring designers, and offer insights into entering the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you find something valuable here that aids your path to
          becoming a designer. If so, feel free to reach out at{" "}
